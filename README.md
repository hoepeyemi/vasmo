> Autonomous AI Treasury Agent for B2B Commerce on Cronos

vasmo is an AI-native treasury management system that transforms how businesses handle invoices. When you create an invoice, our autonomous agent takes over: tokenizing it as a privacy-preserving NFT, deploying capital to yield strategies, and settling payments via x402 rails. It's the first AI treasury agent for Web3 businesses on the Cronos ecosystem.

**[Live Demo](https://vasmo-app.vercel.app/)** · Built for Cronos x402 PayTech Hackathon

## x402: Agentic Finance in Action

vasmo showcases the x402 vision of autonomous financial agents:

- **AI Agent Monitors 24/7** — Continuously analyzes invoice health, risk scores, and yield opportunities
- **Autonomous Strategy Recommendations** — Agent evaluates Conservative vs Aggressive yield strategies based on invoice due dates and payment probability
- **Human-in-the-Loop** — Auto-executes only above 70% confidence; user approves lower-confidence decisions
- **x402 Payment Settlement** — Clients pay invoices directly via smart contract. Machines paying machines.

This is agentic finance infrastructure: machines handling real financial decisions autonomously.

## Cronos Ecosystem Integration

Built natively for the Cronos ecosystem:

- **x402 Payment Rails** — Full implementation of x402 on-chain invoice settlement
- **Cronos EVM Testnet** — Live deployment on Chain ID 338
- **Crypto.com Ecosystem Ready** — Architecture supports [Crypto.com Market Data MCP](https://mcp.crypto.com/docs) integration
- **Pyth Network Oracles** — Price feed infrastructure for real-time risk assessment

---

## Who This Is For

Crypto-native freelancers, consultants, and small agencies who:
- Invoice other businesses on net-30/60/90 terms
- Have $20K+ in outstanding receivables regularly
- Already have a crypto wallet

**Not our user:**
- Businesses that need cash advances (we don't lend)
- Non-crypto users (wallet required, no fiat on-ramp)
- Consumer-facing businesses (B2B invoices only)

---

## What vasmo Does

```
Connect Wallet → Mint Invoice → Deposit to Vault → AI Manages Yield → Client Pays On-Chain → Withdraw
```

1. **Mint** — Create an NFT representing your invoice
2. **Deposit** — Put equivalent CRO into a yield vault
3. **AI Agent** — Monitors and optimizes your yield strategy
4. **Pay** — Client pays invoice directly on-chain via x402
5. **Withdraw** — Get principal + yield when payment settles

---

## What vasmo Does NOT Do

- **Advance cash** — We don't lend against invoices
- **Collect payments** — We don't chase your clients
- **Verify invoices** — We trust what you enter
- **Guarantee returns** — DeFi yields fluctuate
- **Support fiat** — Crypto only
- **Onboard non-crypto users** — Wallet required

---

## Success Criteria

This project succeeds if:
- User can mint an invoice in < 2 minutes
- User can deposit and see yield accruing
- AI agent analyzes and recommends strategies
- Client can pay invoice on-chain
- User can withdraw principal + yield without issues

---

## Scope

**In scope (what we built):**
- Wallet connection (Cronos Testnet)
- Invoice minting (manual entry)
- On-chain payment (x402 pay invoice)
- Deposit to yield vault
- Dashboard (portfolio, yield tracking)
- Withdrawal flow
- AI agent monitoring

**Out of scope (not pursuing):**

- Multi-chain support
- Team/org accounts
- Fiat on-ramp
- Mobile app

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Foundry (for contracts)
- MetaMask with Cronos Testnet configured

### Add Cronos Testnet to MetaMask

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Network Name | Cronos Testnet |
| RPC URL | https://evm-t3.cronos.org |
| Chain ID | 338 |
| Symbol | TCRO |
| Explorer | https://explorer.cronos.org/testnet3 |

Get test CRO from the [Cronos Faucet](https://cronos.org/faucet).

### Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start frontend
cd app && pnpm dev

# Start agent (separate terminal)
cd agent && pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Deploy Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/DeployCronos.s.sol --rpc-url https://evm-t3.cronos.org --broadcast --slow
```

## x402 Payment Flow

The `payInvoice` function enables on-chain invoice settlement:

```solidity
function payInvoice(uint256 tokenId) external payable {
    // Validates invoice is payable (Active or InYield)
    // Transfers payment to invoice owner
    // Updates status to Paid
    // Emits InvoicePaid event
}
```

Clients can pay invoices directly through the UI or programmatically via the smart contract.

## Known Limitations (Hackathon Prototype)

**This is a demonstration project built for Cronos x402 PayTech Hackathon.**

### What's Real vs Simulated

#### Fully Functional
- Smart contracts deployed on Cronos Testnet
- Wallet connection and transaction signing
- Invoice NFT minting and ownership tracking
- On-chain invoice payment (x402)
- Deposit/withdrawal flows
- Dashboard UI and data visualization
- Agent service with WebSocket communication

#### Simulated for Demo
**Yields are SIMULATED:**
- YieldVault uses hardcoded APY rates:
  - Conservative: 3.5% APY (constant)
  - Aggressive: 7.0% APY (constant)
- Yield calculation: `(principal × APY × time) / (365 days × 10000)` on-chain
- Real DeFi integration exists in contract architecture but not activated for demo

**Why simulated?** Integrating live DeFi pools requires production addresses, mainnet liquidity, and complex error handling. For hackathon purposes, simulated yields demonstrate the mechanism.

#### Partial Implementation
**Agent Service:**
- Runs as single Node.js process (port 8080)
- No database persistence (in-memory state only)
- Production would require job queue, PostgreSQL, and monitoring

**Privacy Commitments:**
- Invoice data stored as `keccak256` hashes on-chain
- Reveal verification exists but not used in UI
- True privacy would require zero-knowledge proofs

### Security & Legal Disclaimers

**Not Production-Ready:**
- Smart contracts are **NOT audited**
- No formal security review performed
- Use **testnet only** — do not deposit real funds
- Deployer retains admin privileges

### Honest Assessment

**What we proved:**
- Invoice tokenization is technically feasible
- On-chain payments work (x402)
- AI agents can automate strategy decisions
- Clean architecture and professional UI/UX are possible in Web3

**What we didn't prove:**
- Product-market fit
- Unit economics
- Go-to-market strategy

**This project demonstrates technical competence in agentic finance.**
